      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p><strong>This journal is an exploration of the question: <em>How can wabi-sabi aesthetics influence the development of digital interfaces to promote emotional connection?</em></strong> Through this series of entries, we dive into how embracing imperfection, impermanence, and natural randomness, core concepts of wabi-sabi, can be integrated into digital design. This experiment seeks to humanize technology by creating interactive experiences that evoke a sense of calm, connection, and emotional resonance with users. </p>
      <p><strong><em>Note:</em> You can toggle between different journal entries using the button with the journal symbol, and explore these concepts through each design.</strong></p>

      <h2>Entry 1: Ripples - November 22, 2024</h2>
      <p>Research into wabi-sabi revealed how imperfection, like the random ripple patterns in water, could humanize digital interfaces. I designed a site where users create ripples on click, symbolizing natural randomness and transient beauty.</p>

      <h2>Entry 2: Tree - November 23, 2024</h2>
      <p>Todayâ€™s website features a tree bark texture. Hovering over it creates a subtle displacement, symbolizing the tactile imperfections of nature, providing a sensory connection with the user.</p>

      <h2>Entry 3: Rain - November 24, 2024</h2>
      <p>The site simulates rainfall, and when clicked, users hear soft rain sounds. The random nature of the rain embodies wabi-sabiâ€™s emphasis on impermanence and serenity in digital spaces.</p>

      <h2>Entry 4: Sphere Entry - November 25, 2024</h2>
      <p>A digital sphere reacts to user interaction and light, trapped in a distorted wireframe when pressed. This design merges human interaction with chaotic natural forces, reflecting wabi-sabi's core themes of imperfection.</p>

      <h2>Entry 5: Screen - November 26, 2024</h2>
      <p>Inspired by cracked glass, I designed an interactive screen where cracks form with each tap. The cracks symbolize imperfection and healing, merging wabi-sabi with user interaction to create a shared experience.</p>

      <h2>Entry 6: Leaves - November 27, 2024</h2>
      <p>Users interact with floating leaves that change color as they fall. This randomness, coupled with subtle mouse movements, highlights the fleeting beauty of nature and wabi-sabiâ€™s embrace of impermanence.</p>

      <h2>Entry 7: Cracks - November 28, 2024</h2>
      <p>Todayâ€™s design features golden cracks inspired by kintsugi, symbolizing transformation and the beauty of brokenness. Each tap creates unique cracks, emphasizing wabi-sabiâ€™s acceptance of imperfection in digital design.</p>
